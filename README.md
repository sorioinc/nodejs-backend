# Jibble Test

> Jibble test for backend.

## Installing / Getting started

Feel free to use the code editor of your choice. It has `prettier-eslint` setup;
Visual Studio and Atom have a nice plugin to format and enforce eslint on file
save, you can configure them in the next section.

### For Visual Studio Code

Make sure you have `prettier-vscode` plugin installed

```shell
ext install prettier-vscode
```

Also following settings in your workspace settings:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "prettier.eslintIntegration": true
}
```

### For Atom

Make sure you have `prettier-atom` plugin installed

```shell
apm install prettier-atom
```

* Automatically format on save (requires enabling in `Packages → Prettier
  →Toggle Format on Save`)
* Check the `ESLint Integration` checkbox

## Development

### Built With

* Hapi
* Jest
* ES7
* Prettier
* ESLint
* Gulp

### Prerequisites

#### Node

In order to support `async/await`, you must be running at least version `7.6`,
if you have nvm, make sure you are using that version.

### Setting up Dev

Run the code below:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:sorioinc/nodejs-backend.git
cd nodejs-backend/
npm install
```

### Building

There is no building made (transpilation), this is a Vanilla JS project. But to
run the project, you can execute the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

or if you prefer a live server, that's listening for code changes, then try:

```shell
gulp watch
```

## Tests

The project runs on Jest. You can use any of these command lines:

```shell
npm test
```

or

```shell
gulp test
```

You can also access the coverage reports for the project, that is automatically
generated by Jest. They are located in `coverage/` directory.

## Style guide

The style is driven by ESLint, and it's based upon Airbnb's configuration. Plus,
it makes use of Prettier as a formatter. It is enforced with `git commit hooks`.
We urge you to use the linter to check for javascript / style errors, and
prettier to format the code:

```shell
gulp lint
```

and

```shell
gulp prettier
```

or just

```shell
gulp prettify
```

which takes care of both.

## Documentation

Api documentation is provided by Swagger, you can find it at the server:port the
app is running at, for example: http://localhost:3000/documentation
